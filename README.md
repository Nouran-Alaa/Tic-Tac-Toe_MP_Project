# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Tic-Tac-Toe Game Implementation in Assembly 8086.

## This project aims to:
* Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game that has the functionality of traditional multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe games.
* Learn Assembly level programming, Assembler and Basics of 8086 Microprocessor.

* * *

## The Game

Tic-Tac-Toe is a multiplayer game with two symbols denoting the two players: X and O. Where you can face off friends (and/or yourself) in a tic-tac-toe battle! ðŸ’ª 
The playing board is a 3x3 square.

* * *

## The Emulation Program 
    We Use ( EMU8086 ) to emulate our Code and Open our Program.

## How to play it

1) Open the emulator (emu8086) paste the code and click 'emulate'.
2) Click 'run', and the terminal will appear as the following figure:

3) Choose either 'X' or 'O'.
4) You should choose a number between '1 --> 9' (1,9 included), thus the game wouldn't have any errors.
5) Use tactics to win by filling three adjacent symbols in the grid.

* * *

## Rules

â€¢ Each player takes a turn placing his character (X or O) into one of the nine squares. 
â€¢ A player cannot place his symbol in a square that is already occupied by a symbol. 
â€¢ The game ends when a player creates a winning combination of his symbols or when there are no empty squares remaining. 
â€¢ Winning combination is defined as three horizontally adjacent, three vertically adjacent, or three diagonally adjacent symbols. 
â€¢ If neither player creates a winning combination when all nine squares are occupied, the game is a draw, often referred to as a "cat game."

## Wining Conditions

### You can win by filling:
1- X or O through a whole row <br />
![Rows](https://github.com/Nouran-Alaa/Tic-Tac-Toe_MP_Project/blob/master/Media/Rows.gif) <br />

2- X or O through a whole column <br />

3- X or O through a diagonal <br />
